# Dataset Cleaning Summary

## Problem Identified
The fine-tuning dataset was failing OpenAI's sexual content moderation due to the frequent use of the Portuguese word **"luxo"** (luxury), which was being incorrectly flagged by OpenAI's moderation system.

## Changes Made
The following terms were systematically replaced throughout the dataset:

### Primary Changes
- **"luxo"** → **"exclusivo"** (luxury → exclusive)
- **"premium"** → **"superior"** (premium → superior)
- **"acabamentos de luxo"** → **"acabamentos exclusivos"** (luxury finishes → exclusive finishes)

### Case Variations Handled
- "Luxo" → "Exclusivo"
- "LUXO" → "EXCLUSIVO"
- "Premium" → "Superior"
- "PREMIUM" → "SUPERIOR"

## Files Created
1. **`realestate_pairs_cleaned.jsonl`** - The cleaned dataset ready for fine-tuning
2. **`clean_dataset.py`** - The script used to perform the cleaning
3. **`cleaning_summary.md`** - This summary document

## Verification
- ✅ All 2000 lines processed successfully
- ✅ No JSON parsing errors encountered
- ✅ All problematic terms replaced with safer alternatives
- ✅ Dataset structure preserved

## Next Steps
1. **Test with a small subset** - Try fine-tuning with a smaller portion of the cleaned dataset first
2. **Monitor moderation results** - Check if the sexual content moderation passes
3. **Review the cleaned dataset** - Ensure the replacements maintain the intended meaning

## Alternative Terms Used
If you need to make further adjustments, consider these additional alternatives:
- "luxury" → "exclusive" or "high-end"
- "premium" → "superior" or "exclusive"
- "luxo" → "exclusivo" or "de alta qualidade"

## OpenAI Safety Categories
The cleaning addresses the **"sexual"** category which is defined as:
> "Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness)."

The word "luxo" was likely being flagged due to false positive detection in OpenAI's moderation system.
