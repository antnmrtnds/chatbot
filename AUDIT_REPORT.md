# Chatbot Integration Audit Report

**Date:** 2024-07-29
**Status:** Complete

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit reviews the current implementation of the embeddable chatbot feature against the requirements defined in the Product Requirements Document (`src/embedding.md`). 

The audit reveals that the current implementation is at a very early stage and **does not meet the core functional and technical requirements** outlined in the PRD. Key areas such as security, multi-tenancy, and customization are missing entirely. The existing code appears to be a proof-of-concept for a single-site chatbot rather than a scalable, multi-client solution.

## 2. Audit Findings by Area

### 2.1. Embeddable Script (`src/embed.ts`, `FloatingChatbot.tsx`)

| Requirement | Status | Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Use Custom Element (`<viriato-chatbot>`) | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | The script injects the chatbot into a standard `<div>`. It does not define a custom element. |
| Use Shadow DOM for Encapsulation | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | No Shadow DOM is used. Styles are not isolated, posing a risk of CSS conflicts with the host page. |
| API Key Integration | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | The script does not accept or use an API key for authentication. API endpoints are hardcoded. |
| Lightweight & Asynchronous | ðŸŸ¡ **Partially Met** | The script is loaded, but its dependencies (React, ReactDOM) could impact host page performance. |
| Customization | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | There are no props or mechanisms to customize the chatbot's color, icon, or position. |

### 2.2. Admin Dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

| Requirement | Status | Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Website Integration" Section | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | No such section exists. The current dashboard is for managing Pinecone documents. |
| API Key Generation & Management | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | There is no functionality to generate, display, copy, or regenerate API keys. |
| Whitelisted Domains | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | No interface exists to manage whitelisted domains for API key usage. |
| Chatbot Appearance Customization | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | No UI controls are available for changing the chatbot's color or launcher icon. |
| Positioning Options | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | No options are available to set the chatbot widget's position. |
| Live Preview | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | As there are no customization options, there is no live preview. |

### 2.3. Backend & API (`src/app/apis/chat/route.ts`)

| Requirement | Status | Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| API Key Authentication | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | The API endpoints are open and do not perform any authentication. |
| Domain Whitelisting (CORS) | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | The backend does not enforce a domain whitelist. Requests from any origin would be accepted. |
| Scalability & Multi-Tenancy | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | The database schema (`chat_messages`, `visitors`) lacks any client identifier. Data from all sources would be co-mingled, which is not a scalable or secure multi-tenant solution. |
| Versioning | ðŸ”´ **Not Met** | No versioning strategy for the API or embed script is apparent. |

## 3. High-Level Recommendations

To align the implementation with the PRD, the following high-level actions are recommended:

1.  **Re-architect the Embed Script**: The script should be rebuilt as a proper Web Component using the Shadow DOM to ensure style encapsulation and prevent conflicts with host websites. It should be designed to accept an API key and configuration options.
2.  **Build the Admin Dashboard**: A new section must be created in the admin dashboard for "Website Integration." This section should include all the features specified in the PRD, such as API key management and customization controls.
3.  **Implement a Secure API Gateway**: The backend API needs a robust security layer. This should include:
    *   A new table in the database to store client accounts, API keys, and whitelisted domains.
    *   A middleware or API gateway that authenticates every request using the provided API key and validates the origin against the whitelisted domains.
4.  **Update the Database Schema**: The database schema must be updated to support multi-tenancy. All relevant tables (e.g., `chat_messages`, `visitors`, `interactions`) should include a `client_id` or `api_key` column to ensure data is properly segregated between different clients.

The current implementation requires a significant development effort to meet the product requirements. The recommendations above provide a roadmap for building a secure, scalable, and customizable embeddable chatbot solution.
